ipython_graphdash
=================

Alternative graph based dashboard for IPython Notebooks

Nodes represent notebooks and links between them refer to links in markdown cells pointing at other notebooks.

To use copy/append the contents of ipython_graphdash/custom to your IPython profile (default is usually ~/.ipython/profile_default/static/custom).

Launch an IPython Notebook from within ipython_graphdash/example_tree and click the graphview icon (next to the New Notebook and Refresh icons) to get an idea of what's going on.

To use in another folder launch an IPython notebook server from that folder and hit the refresh notebook list button to generate the notebook tree.

Note: Requires IPython 2.x
